  description: How do we demonstrate that a brain network feature is statistically unexpected? Null models are an inferential tool to assess the presence or magnitude of features, by selectively preserving specific architectural properties of brain networks while randomizing others. We develop and systematically benchmark null models to understand the architecture of brain networks.

  description: A fundamental question in connectomics is how the organization of brain networks supports neural signaling. Using anatomically realistic brain networks derived from imaging and tracing, we develop computational models of inter-regional communication. We use these models to characterize how communication processes unfold on structural brain networks and how they support cognitive capacity.
